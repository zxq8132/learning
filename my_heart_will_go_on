夜阑梦境中Every night in my dreams
与君相望相融I see you, I feel you,
妾晓君咫尺That is how I know you go on
纵使天高路远Far across the distance，And spaces between us
君语妾：“惜”You have come to show you go on
天边地角，人海苍茫Near, far, wherever you are
我心君属I believe that the heart does go on
心扉洞开Once more you open the door
君光照之And you're here in my heart
我心永恒And my heart will go on and on
爱无价，两心相印Love can touch us one time
此情贯穿一生And last for a lifetime
永不灭And never let go till we're one
爱汝之心不改Love was when I loved you，One true time I hold to
携手夕阳红In my life we'll always go on
天边地角，人海苍茫Near, far, wherever you are
我心君属I believe that the heart does go on
心扉洞开Once more you open the door
君光照之And you're here in my heart
我心永恒my heart will go on and on
与君相伴，乘风破浪You're here, there's nothing I fear,
两心相印，And I know that my heart will go on
不离不弃We'll stay forever this way
君永将驻You are safe in my heart
我心永恒And my heart will go on and on这一行是python追加过来的！
